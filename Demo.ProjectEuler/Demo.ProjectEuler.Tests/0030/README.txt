Digit fifth powers
Problem 30
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 14^4 + 64^4 + 34^4 + 44^4
8208 = 84^4 + 24^4 + 04^4 + 84^4
9474 = 94^4 + 44^4 + 74^4 + 44^4
As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
